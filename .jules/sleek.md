# Sleek's Journal - Architectural Debt & Refactoring Wins

## 2026-05-21 - Alert Condition Logic Refinement
**Clutter:** The `_check_alerts` method in `MQTTIngestClient` uses a repetitive `if/elif` chain to evaluate alert conditions (`gt`, `lt`, etc.).
**Refactoring Win:** Replacing the `if/elif` chain with a mapping to `operator` functions improves readability and extensibility. This is a high-traffic code path as it executes for every incoming MQTT message.
